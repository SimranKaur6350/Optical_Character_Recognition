# Optical_Character_Recognition
Optical Character Recognition using Hybrid CNN-RNN based Lexicon-Free approach
The objective of the project to implement character and word recognition. This
functionality is successfully implemented using deep learning by applying a
CRNN architecture. Since CRNN is a broad framework, it can be used to
solve various domain-specific issues involving sequence prediction in images, such
as Chinese character recognition. Another direction that merits investigation in
the future is to accelerate CRNN even more and make it more useful in real-world applications.


The development of this project using this architecture allowed the exploration of different neural network architectures leading to a hybrid structure
of using CNNs and RNNs along with CTC loss and grey wolf optimization. The test acccuracy with the condition that every character to be exactly correct is obtained
to be 85.28%.
